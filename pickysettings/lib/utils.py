def paths_overlap(base_path, path):
    """
    Returns True if the the two paths overlap and False if they do not.

    Overlapping Paths:  Defined as paths that are not relative to one another
    but share a common path, up until a certain point, when moving from the
    lowest point of the path towards the top of the paths.

    Examples:
    --------
        (base_path, path)
        ('/Users/Desktop/Folder/Documents', 'Folder/Documents'),
        ('Users/John/Desktop/Private/settings', 'Private/settings/dev.py'),

    Methodology
    -----------
    We do this by walking backwards over the path and finding the first point
    in which overlapping with the base_path occurs, if any:

        >>> base_path = ['System', 'Users', 'John', 'Desktop', 'settings']
        >>> path = ['John', 'Desktop', 'settings', 'file.py']

    Walk over ['file.py', 'settings', ...]
    The value 'settings' is the first place where overlapping occurs, at
    `overlapping_index` = 1.

    Starting at the `overlapping_index`, everything in the path must have an equal
    counter part in the base_path, starting at index 0.

        >>> reversed_base_parts = ['settings', 'Desktop', 'John', 'Users', 'System']
        >>> reversed_parts = ['settings', 'Desktop', 'John']

    Note that if both paths are absolute, this will fail, since the path parts
    cannot be the same length (otherwise they would be relative to each other)
    and '/' would not match with it's counterpart in the other path:

        >>> reversed_base_parts = ['file.py', 'dev', '/']
        >>> reversed_parts = ['file.py', 'dev', 'settings', 'Users', '/']

    [x] Note:
    --------
    This is different than two paths being relative.  In fact, the two paths
    cannot be relative to one another for this to work.
